- Factor 1: School's presence attracts both students and staff, potentially increasing foot traffic and criminal opportunities. 
- Factor 2: Drinking water and bicycle parking amenities may not be directly related to crime, but could indicate a higher level of activity in the area.
Crime Prevention Suggestions:
- Increase police patrols around school hours
- Implement CCTV cameras in high-crime areas

**Cluster 1 - 15699 crimes**
Main Amenities: bicycle parking, drinking water, fire station
Potential Factors:
- Factor 1: Bicycle parking and drinking water amenities may indicate a higher level of human activity, increasing opportunities for crime.
- Factor 2: Fire station's presence could lead to increased emergency response times, potentially reducing criminal opportunity windows.
Crime Prevention Suggestions:
- Install improved lighting in bike parking areas
- Collaborate with fire department on joint patrols

**Cluster 5 - 361 crimes**
Main Amenities: cafe, bar, restaurant, place of worship, parking, studio
Potential Factors:
- Factor 1: Presence of restaurants, bars, and cafes may attract late-night crowds, increasing criminal opportunities.
- Factor 2: Place of worship could indicate a higher level of community engagement, potentially reducing crime rates.

Crime Prevention Suggestions:
- Increase police patrols around high-crime areas
- Implement regular cleaning schedules for public spaces

Now, here are the overall conclusions about the dataset:

1. Top 3 cross-cluster patterns:
	* Presence of schools and drinking water amenities in clusters 0 and 1 may indicate higher crime rates due to increased human activity.
	* Clusters with multiple food and beverage options (clusters 5, 6) tend to have lower crime rates, potentially indicating a safer environment for community gatherings.
	* Police presence seems to be a common factor in reducing crime rates (clusters 13 and 1).

2. Highest-risk amenity types:
	* Fast food and drinking water amenities seem to be associated with higher crime rates.

3. One city-wide policy recommendation:
	* Implement a comprehensive urban planning strategy that incorporates CPTED principles, focusing on creating safer public spaces through improved lighting, surveillance, and community engagement.

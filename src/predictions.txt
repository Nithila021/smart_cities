**Cluster Analysis Summary**

1. **Top 3 Cross-Cluster Patterns:**
	* Presence of schools and drinking water amenities in clusters 0 and 1 may indicate higher crime rates due to increased human activity.
	* Clusters with multiple food and beverage options (clusters 5, 6) tend to have lower crime rates, potentially indicating a safer environment for community gatherings.
	* Police presence seems to be a common factor in reducing crime rates (clusters 13 and 1).

2. **Highest-Risk Amenity Types:**
	* Fast food and drinking water amenities seem to be associated with higher crime rates.

3. **City-Wide Policy Recommendation:**
	* Implement a comprehensive urban planning strategy that incorporates CPTED principles, focusing on creating safer public spaces through improved lighting, surveillance, and community engagement.

**Future Crime Predictions and Relevant Issues:**

Based on the analysis, it is predicted that:

1. Clusters with high foot traffic (e.g., near schools or food establishments) will continue to experience higher crime rates.
2. Areas with poor lighting or inadequate surveillance may be more prone to criminal activity.
3. The presence of police stations can help reduce crime rates in surrounding areas.

To address these concerns, the city should:

1. Prioritize urban planning initiatives that incorporate CPTED principles and prioritize lighting, surveillance, and community engagement.
2. Implement data-driven policing strategies to target high-crime areas.
3. Develop community programs and initiatives to promote community engagement and reduce criminal opportunities.

By addressing these factors, the city can work towards creating safer public spaces and reducing crime rates in the long term.
